CMSC 22 Game

BlockScape is the name of our capstone project as requirement in our CMSC 22, Object-Oriented Programming subject.

The goal of the game is to reach the platform where the door is so that the next level could be unclocked. In order for the player to do that, he must first get they key without falling or getting hit by falling objects. When the player is hit or has fallen, the game will restart from the beginning of the particular level. As the level of the game increases, the difficulty as well increases.

The game is programmed in Java. The game is currently in the alpha state, still a work in progress.
(There are still some bugs in our code.) 

Disclaimer: The images used in the game is not ours and we do give credits to our sources. Hopefully, we could enumerate them here by as we finish our game.

Group members: Arsolon, Lovely Grace; Bonganay, Arvin (Group Leader); Rumaguera, Leah; Uy, Jhessa.
